to run the code call the function sudoku(name) where name is the name of the input file.

The code uses backtracking algorithm - source: wikipedia

Initially we had used a different algorithm which was simpler but it was only able to solve easier sudokus.
This one can solve all.

The code is modular to increase readability and usability.
